         <h1>Modal</h1>
         <p>A modal in JavaScript (and web development in general) is a type of dialog box or popup window that
             appears on top of the main content of a webpage, typically requiring the user to interact with it
              before they can return to the main content. Modals are often used for various purposes like 
              displaying alerts, asking for confirmations, presenting forms, or showing additional information
               without navigating away from the current page.</p>
